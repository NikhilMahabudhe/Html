            <h1>Transport</h1>
            <p>Wardha city is well-connected by roads to the other cities of Maharashtra. National Highway No.361
                (Nagpur-Wardha-Yavatmal-Nanded-Latur-Tuljapur) passes through the city. Nagpur-Aurangabad-Mumbai Express
                Highway also passes through it. Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' dream project Samruddhi
                Mahamarg or Nagpur-Mumbai Communication Super Expressway will also pass from the outskirts of the city.

                Wardha city is well-connected to most of the parts of India by railways. Wardha railway station is an
                important rail junction on the Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line. The town is also connected to the southern
                part of the country through Sevagram railway station. Traffic on the Mumbai-Kolkata route is mainly
                dealt with at Wardha Station, and traffic on the Delhi-Chennai route is dealt with at Sewagram Station
                (formerly Wardha East station).[citation needed] A new Wardha–Nanded line via Yavatmal, Pusad, and Deoli
                is being constructed. Both the Delhi-Chennai and the Mumbai-Kolkata railway routes are already carrying
                heavy traffic and both routes are actually one between Sewagram and Nagpur stations. A new third and
                fourth line is under construction between Sewagram and Nagpur stations to cater to the heavy traffic.

                services.</p>
            <h1>Economy</h1>
            <p>Cotton farming and soybean cultivation in Kharif is quite common. The government has provided canals to
                irrigate during Rabi season when bengal gram (chickpea) becomes a popular choice to sow.

                Many institutions are encouraging farmers to go natural or organic, but the lack of support systems
                either with the availability of techniques or the marketability of this produce is preventing the spread
                of this movement.

                Wardha is becoming the second industrial hub of the Vidarbha area.[1] This is due to its geographical
                location and good rail and road connectivity. In the last few decades, many companies and industrial
                plants were established there. Some of the major industrial plants include steel and powerplant
                factories.

                Wardha IT park of C. Dass group is under construction at the IT park in the city. It is the second in
                the Vidarbha region after Nagpur. It is located at MIDC area on the Wardha-Sevagram road.</p>

            <h1>Sevagram Ashram</h1>
            <p>Sevagram Ashram was the residence of Mahatma Gandhi from 1936 to 1948. After his 1930 Dandi salt march,
                he decided not to return to his ashram at Sabarmati. After spending two years in jail, he travelled
                around India and, at the invitation of the Gandhian industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj, stayed for some time
                in Wardha City at Jamnalal's bungalow.[8] In 1936, at the age of 67, Gandhiji moved to a village (which
                he subsequently called Sewagram - (Hindi for village of service) at the outskirts of Wardha and started
                to live here in a group of huts with his wife Kasturba and other disciples. This slowly grew into an
                ashram, where Gandhi lived with his followers for the next twelve years, until his death. The premises
                are very calming. Many personal items used by Gandhi and his contemporaries are preserved here including
                his spectacles, telephone, notebook, tables, mats, etc...[9]</p>

            <h1>Kelzar Ganpati Mandir</h1>
            <p>The Kelzar Ganpati Mandir is about 26 km (16 mi) from Wardha on the Nagpur Road. This temple is on a hill
                and is surrounded by the scenic beauty of forests and hills near the Bor National Tiger Reserve and Bird
                Sanctuary. It is a historical place and its history goes back to Vashishtha Purana.

                The place is also mentioned in Mahabharata as Ekchakranagari. According to myth, Pandavas lived here
                during agyatvas. Bhima killed Bakasura at this place and threw him down this hill. An ancient cave where
                Bakasura lived is at foot of the hill and his famous well is also nearby. This well has sculptured
                stones on its inner wall and stairs. Remains of an old fort are also seen here. Finding sculptures
                during digging for any purpose is common. Sculptures relating to Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism have
                been found, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is not paying attention to this. Many sculptures
                have been ruined due to lack of proper care. Some sculptures can be seen in this temple, on a nearby
                hillock, the gram panchayat office, the Buddha Vihar.

                Wardha.</p>
